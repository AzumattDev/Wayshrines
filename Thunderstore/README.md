### Call upon Heimdall to take you to other wayshrines or back to your set spawn point. The Wayshrine is surrounded by a small 'NoMonsterArea' to aid in your escape. You will not be targeted by monsters in this area.



## Things you need to know


* I highly recommend using SpawnThat to allow the Wayshrine to appear around the map (if someone makes a decent one, I will begin to include them in the download)
* When using the Wayshrine you will shout out to Heimdall to take you to other Wayshrines around the map OR taking you to your set spawn point (Original functionality required for spawn point teleport. If you do not have a bed, it takes you to world spawn point).
* `Only admins can build/destroy the Wayshrines. Syncs with server admin list.`
* Config can be changed on while on the server by an admin using Configuration Managers (Default BepInEx or Aedenthorn's), no need for reboot. Changing the config file manually, will require a reboot of the server.
* **COMMAND**: delway in console or /delway in chat to delete all Wayshrines found in the world.

## Installation Instructions

>***You must have BepInEx installed correctly! I can not stress this enough.***

#### Windows (Steam)
1. Locate your game folder manually or start Steam client and :
   a. Right click the Valheim game in your steam library
   b. "Go to Manage" -> "Browse local files"
   c. Steam should open your game folder
2. Extract the contents of the archive into the BepInEx/plugins folder. Config file will generate on first boot.
3. Your config file will be located in BepInEx/config. Though, I do recommend getting a configuration manager to change the config from within the game.

#### Server

Must be installed on both the client and the server for syncing admins/configs to work properly.
1. Locate your main folder manually and :
   a. Extract the contents of the archive into the BepInEx/plugins folder.
   b. Locate Azumatt.Wayshrine.cfg under BepInEx\config on your machine and configure the mod to your needs
2. Reboot your server.
