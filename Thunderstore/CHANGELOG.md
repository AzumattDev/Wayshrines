> ### Version 1.1.0
> * Much needed updates.
> * Truth be told, most of the code changes have been sitting here for over a year. I just never got around to releasing them. So, I barely remember what I changed.
> ### Version 1.0.6
> * Complete re-write of code. Should be fixed for Hearth and Home, other mod compatibility, and known error from 1.0.5 fixed.
> * Admin command moved to H&H methods of doing them. delway in console or /delway in chat to delete all Wayshrines found in the world.
> * I lost some of the original Unity project and had to rebuild the assets, so there might be some texture/particle differences.
> * I removed the spawn that config file in this version as I don't know how good that file is anymore. Feel free to make and provide one if you wish. I'll include it in future downloads.
> ### Version 1.0.5
> * More singleplayer fixes
> * Customize shout message
> * Map pin fixes for Multiplayer and Singleplayer
> * Additional Wayshrine added
> * Map pins now specific to Wayshrine
> * NOTE: Known error output on entering the skull Wayshrine's collider for teleport
> ### Version 1.0.4
> * Single player FPS issue fixed. Map pins are a little broken, they do not update automatically like they do in Multiplayer. Not sure why, working on fixes.
> * Admin command to remove ALL wayshrines from the world regardless of distance or owner. Use !delway or !deletewayshrines in the console. Will work to add this to chat, testing with VChat when using the command caused game crashes after the latest game update.
> * Config options added
> *  General refactoring of code with some optimizations.
> ### Version 1.0.3
> * Fixed bug that causes issues with Jotunn mod's recipes
> ### Version 1.0.2
> * NOTE: Feel free to upload your own pictures and videos of this mod to the mod page!
> * Wayshrine_Skull added, has double functionality for original and world wayshrine teleports. Interact for original..walk onto skull for world teleport
> * Config options added. Server admins can change configs while on the server using configuration managers, no need for reboots
> * Wayshrines are now linked together. Interact with them to choose one on the map. Map pins will periodically update if they don't immediately show when a wayshrine spawns/is placed.
> * Wayshrines have visual changes to begin reflecting biomes in a better manner
> * Assets reduced in size to help with file size overall.
> * Custom bifrost effect with thunderclap sound on teleport
